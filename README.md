These are repro steps for issue https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4098

# Setup

There are two packages: `foo` and `bar`. `bar` is 'injected' into `foo` using `dependenciesMeta.*.injected`.

# Reproduction steps

1. Run `pnpm install`.
2. Observe lockfile doesn't change since it is already up to date.
3. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
4. **Expected:** Install should succeed.

   **Actual:** Fails with the following error:
   ```
   ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILEâ€‰ Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up-to-date with package.json
   ```
